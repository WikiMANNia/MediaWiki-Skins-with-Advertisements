Hooks provided by the Wima skin.

'WimaTemplateToolboxEnd': DEPRECATED. Called by Wima skin after toolbox
links have been rendered (useful for adding more). Note: this is only run for
the Wima skin. To add items to the toolbox you should use the
SkinTemplateToolboxEnd hook instead, which works for all "SkinTemplate"-type
skins.
$tools: array of tools
